After that, the online-connection must have been closed. Incorrect caching of client data then may lead to privilege escalation, where a subsequently acting non-admin user is permitted to do telegram simulation. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a potential attacker would need to have both a valid engineering-account in the SPRECON RBAC system as well as access to a service\/maintenance computer with SPRECON-E Service Program running. Additionally, a valid admin-user must have closed the service connection beforehand without closing the program, having executed telegram simulation; the attacker then has access to the running software instance. Hence, there is no risk from external attackers.","refs":{"ref":["https:\/\/www.sprecher-automation.com\/en\/it-security\/","95296"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2016-10042","seq":"2016-10042"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"Authorization Bypass in the Web interface of Arcadyan SLT-00 Star* (aka Swisscom Internet-Box) devices before R7.7 allows unauthorized reconfiguration of the static routing table via an unauthenticated HTTP request, leading to denial of service and information disclosure.","refs":{"ref":"https:\/\/www.swisscom.ch\/content\/dam\/swisscom\/de\/about\/nachhaltigkeit\/digitale-schweiz\/sicherheit\/bug-bounty\/files\/cve-2016-10042.txt"},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2016-10043","seq":"2016-10043"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"An issue was discovered in Radisys MRF Web Panel (SWMS) 9.0.1.
