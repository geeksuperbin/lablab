The vulnerability arises with certain unclosed tags in emails that cause markup to be handled incorrectly leading to scan timeouts.

Because of this, we are missing the \"text\" event to deal with the object normally. This can cause carefully crafted emails that might take more scan time than expected leading to a Denial of Service. The issue is possibly a bug or design decision in HTML::Parser that specifically impacts the way Apache SpamAssassin uses the module with poorly formed html.
