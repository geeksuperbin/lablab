NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the February 2012 Oracle CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a downstream vendor and third party researchers that this issue occurs because the AtomicReferenceArray class implementation does not ensure that the array is of the Object[] type, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (JVM crash) or bypass Java sandbox restrictions.  NOTE: this issue was originally mapped to CVE-2011-3571, but that identifier was already assigned to a different
