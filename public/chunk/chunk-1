There are some\nfeatures of Maximizer 6.0 that, if abused, could allow someone\nto do some bad things.  For example, an attacker could modify\nthe email addresses for contacts to redirect sales to\nlocations besides the customer.  There's also a capability of\nassigning priorities and alarms, which could be susceptible to\nan \"inconvenience attack\" at the very least, as well as\ntie-ins to e-commerce capabilities.\n\nThe critical question becomes: \"how is this data shared\" in\nthe first place?  If it's through a network share or other\ndistribution method besides transferring the complete database\nbetween sites, then this may be accessible to any attacker who\ncan mimic a Maximizer client (if there is such a thing as a\nclient), and this could be a vulnerability or exposure\naccording to the CVE definition.\n\nHowever, since the Maximizer functionality is unknown to me\nand not readily apparent from product documentation, it's hard\nto know what to do about this one.","[Frech changed vote from REVIEWING to MODIFY]","XF:maximizer-enterprise-calendar-modification(7590)"]}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-1999-1173","seq":"1999-1173"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Proposed","desc":"Corel Word Perfect 8 for Linux creates a temporary working directory with world-writable permissions, which allows local users to (1) modify Word Perfect behavior by modifying files in the working directory, or (2) modify files of other users via a symlink attack.","refs":{"ref":"19981218 wordperfect 8 for linux security"},"votes":{"noop":"Cole, Foat, Wall"},"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-1999-1174","seq":"1999-1174"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Proposed","desc":"ZIP drive for Iomega ZIP-100 disks allows attackers with physical access to the drive to bypass password protection by inserting a known disk with a known password, waiting for the ZIP drive to power down, manually replacing the known disk with the target disk, and using the known password to access the target disk.","refs":{"ref":"http:\/\/www.counterpane.com\/crypto-gram-9812.html#doghouse"},"votes":{"accept":"Cole","noop":"Foat, Wall"},"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CVE","name":"CVE-1999-1175","seq":"1999-1175"},"status":"Entry","desc":"Web Cache Control Protocol (WCCP) in Cisco Cache Engine for Cisco IOS 11.2 and earlier does not use authentication, which allows remote attackers to redirect HTTP traffic to arbitrary hosts via WCCP packets to UDP port 2048.","refs":{"ref":["19980513 Cisco Web Cache Control Protocol Router Vulnerability","I-054","cisco-wccp-vuln(1577)"]}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-1999-1176","seq":"1999-1176"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Proposed","desc":"Buffer overflow in cidentd ident daemon allows local users to gain root privileges via a long line in the .authlie script.","refs":{"ref":["19980110 Cidentd","19980911 Re: security problems with jidentd","http:\/\/spisa.act.uji.es\/spi\/progs\/codigo\/www.hack.co.za\/exploits\/daemon\/ident\/cidentd.c"]},"votes":{"modify":"Frech","noop":"Cole, Foat, Wall"},"comments":{"comment":"XF:cidentd-authlie-bo(7327)"}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CVE","name":"CVE-1999-1177","seq":"1999-1177"},"status":"Entry","desc":"Directory traversal vulnerability in nph-publish before 1.2 allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via a ..

However, they also link this issue to\nSCO advisory 99.17, although the advisory itself is too vague\nto *really* know what vulns they fixed.  And now the link\nto a potentially more detailed document (sse037.ltr)\nis broken.  So we don't have any independent reason for\nknowing whether SCO 99.17 (a) addresses any \"sar\"\nvulnerabilities, and (b) even if it does, whether it addresses\n*both* the -o and -f arguments originally claimed by Tellier.\nFinally, it seems rather curious that CSSA-2002-SCO.17\ntalks about a -o overflow but does not mention -f.\nSounds like an email to the security people at SCO\nis in order...\n\nOK.  Having consulted with SCO (who responded quickly), I\nlooked even further into this issue.  There is now sufficient\nevidence that the -f overflow was fixed in 1999.

SEE THE \nEDITORIAL BOARD ARCHIVES FOR DETAILS, BEGINNING AT\n\nhttp:\/\/cve.mitre.org\/Board_Sponsors\/archives\/msg00590.html\n\n**********************************************************"," \nI suggest we I'd like to suggest that we consider not tying\nspecifically to a DDOS tool.  Instead, since we are at at higher\nabstraction level, that we make the class include those master\/slave\ntool combinations that are used for malicious purposes (i.e. DDOS,\ndata exfiltration, or whatever the appropriate classes of effect are).\n\nMy concern is that (1) we treat all distributed attacks at the same\nabstract level; not just the DDOS ones.  Second, if it is at a higher\nabstraction level then it seems right to unlimit it (by including\nmaster\/slave combinations in general; not just the DDOS asect).","I think that trinoo etc... are very similar to smurf attacks\n(CVE-1999-0513 ) in the sense that a third party allows itself to be\nused.  Also, there is an  obvious solution that can only be done by\nthat third party.\n\nAs for the CVE entry, I am considering whether the common entry point\ncould be reduced to \"egress filtering has not been implemented or has\nbeen disabled, allowing the sending of spoofed IP packets\".\nIncidentally, this would prevent the use of decoys in port scans,\netc...  This single CVE entry would be very powerful. We could use\nthe dot notation to list the DDoS tools and attacks that rely on the\nabsence of egress filtering based on the argument that if you have\negress filtering, nobody will bother to put or use DDoS tools on your\ncomputers.\n\nThe weakness of this is that one could in theory still use DDoS tools\neven if you have egress filtering -- only they will be one shot guns,\nalmost completely eliminating their appeal and effectiveness.  One\nuse, and they will be blocked, tracked down and destroyed\nefficiently.\n\nPascal\n\nP.S.: I am attracted by the idea of starting an internet (fire)wall\nof shame, for people who haven't implemented egress filtering.  It\nworked pretty well against sites allowing themselves to be used for\nsmurf attacks (http:\/\/www.powertech.no\/smurf\/).  Why not use the same\nstrategy for egress filtering?  Of course it's hard to know who is\nthe source of IP spoofed  packets.  However the consistent detection\nof crud originating from a server is a sure sign that they haven't\nimplemented egress filtering.  For example (my first candidate to\nthis wall of shame), this weekend the Linux suse ftp server sent many\npackets with an illegal ip address as source, one reserved for local\narea networks, upon making an ftp connection (it may still be doing\nit, I haven't checked since -- the suse ftp admin mentioned that they\nwere aware of it).  It was easy to figure out it was them by\nrepeating the ftp connections and observing the 100% reproducibility\nand time correlation of the extraneous packets.  In addition, the\nsuse servers kept sending me crud for *hours* after a failed attempt\nto download their PPC beta.\n\nThe cost of egress filtering is easily justified.  The argument is\nsimilar to those relating to pollution, excepted that people don't\ntry to break into your car if you have removed the catalytic\nconverter.","I need to think about the exact meaning of MP. I suspect I\nwill agree with the classification, on an operational basis\n(meaning I may want to revisit it), but I want to think on it\nsome more.","I don't agree with Pascal that this is a filtering problem analogous to\nsmurf.  Rootkit is a better analogy.  The DDoS software doesn't exploit\nany unique vulnerability directly.  It's presence is entirely predicated\non the existence of at least one other, easily exploited vulnerability.","From the perspective of the system owner, this is just one of several\nbackdoors that could be installed.  Seems to me that the presence of a\nknown backdoor package should be considered a vulnerability (or at least\nan exposure).\n\nI'm really torn on whether or not to split them out, though.  My\ninclination is to group master and slave by package; i.e., trinoo\nmaster\/slave, tfn master\/slave, etc.\n"," \nJust to be consistent, you may add Trinoo (trin00) and does it matter\nif it is Tribal or Tribe?  The original internal c program says Tribe Flood\nNetwork.","What they have in common is the use of an amplification mechanism.\nThey are broadcasting (multicasting) to a (virtual private) network,\nwhich then amplifies the messages.  In both cases, the amplification\nis done by the third party victim hosts.  The difference is just that\nthe network is virtual instead of physical.\n\n\nScott, you are assuming that the people who have the tools installed\nare unwilling.  Let's say theoretically speaking that there is an\nunderground hacker group (or student association) who is hooked up to\nDSL lines (like in university residences) and who thinks that it\nwould be \"cool\" to form an \"army\".  How about a popular civil\nmovement protesting something, like the WTO last summer?  I think\nsome people would voluntarily \"enlist\" their computers in a cause\nthat would use DDoS attacks.  The rootkit analogy does not hold, yet\nthe DDoS attacks could be just as effective.  However, if the\nuniversity or ISPs implemented egress filtering, the DDoS attacks\ncould be easily stopped because the people could be held accountable.\nThe crux of the matter is the anonymity provided by IP spoofing.\n\nYou are correct that in most cases, having a DDoS tool installed on\nyour system is an exposure like rootkit.  Maybe that deserves a CVE\nentry.  However, I think that does not capture the nature of the\nDDoS, and that an entry about egress filtering is of utmost\nimportance because it patches a fundamental vulnerability of IPv4.","Excellent response, Pascal, thanks.  I hadn't thought of people\nvolunteering, but that's certainly a plausible scenario.  Part of my\nmotivation\/thinking was a desire to stay away from making this into only\nyet another use for spoofed IP packets.  I wholeheartedly agree that\negress filtering essential, but am reluctant to single out the recent DDoS\nevents as the reason for it.\n\nI'd prefer to split out egress filtering as a seperate CVE entry (on the\ntheory that not using egress filtering constitutes an exposure -- at least\nto liability), rather than tying it to these entries.","I agree with Scott for no other reason that there needs to be a CVE\nID so that IDS systems can report this things.\n\nAre we going to start handing out CVE ids for low level design faults?\nE.g. lack of encryption at the IPv4 packet level? lack of resource\nallocation protocols? the used of DES instead of Triple DES? etc","Both excellent points, however, I'd like to add that even if people\nvolunteer to host the tools, Trinoo and company allow the controlling\nattacker to hide activities, which counts as an exposure under\nhttp:\/\/cve.mitre.org\/About_CVE\/About\/definition.html","Even with all of the debate i accept this one.","With respect to inclusion of design flaws in CVE, review\nhttp:\/\/cve.mitre.org\/Board_Sponsors\/archives\/msg00602.html\n\nOther design flaws that have already been added to CVE\ninclude Smurf (CVE-1999-0513), Fraggle (CVE-1999-0514)\nand TCP sequence number prediction (CVE-1999-0077), although\nthis last one may need to be RECAST to a lower level of\nabstraction.","[Meunier changed vote from REVIEWING to RECAST]","In the sense that this is like a rootkit, then it is a\nduplicate of CVE-1999-0660, \"A hacker utility or Trojan Horse is\ninstalled on a system, e.g. NetBus, Back Orifice, Rootkit, etc...\"\n\nIt should be recast as CVE-1999-0660.1 DDoS tools\nOther dot notations could indicate different effects of the tools.","There doesn't seem to be much to add to the\ndiscussion.","Concur that this is a hacker utility, and should be recast and merged with other backdoor programs that allow a hacker to control the activities of the system."]}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CVE","name":"CVE-2000-0139","seq":"2000-0139"},"status":"Entry","desc":"Internet Anywhere POP3 Mail Server allows local users to cause a denial of service via a malformed RETR command.","refs":{"ref":["20000210 remote DoS on Internet Anywhere Mail Server Ver.3.1.3","982"]}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CVE","name":"CVE-2000-0140","seq":"2000-0140"},"status":"Entry","desc":"Internet Anywhere POP3 Mail Server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of connections.","refs":{"ref":["20000210 remote DoS on Internet Anywhere Mail Server Ver.3.1.3","20000210 remote DoS on Internet Anywhere Mail Server Ver.3.1.3","980"]}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CVE","name":"CVE-2000-0141","seq":"2000-0141"},"status":"Entry","desc":"Infopop Ultimate Bulletin Board (UBB) allows remote attackers to execute commands via shell metacharacters in the topic hidden field.","refs":{"ref":["20000211 perl-cgi hole in UltimateBB by Infopop Corp.","20000225 FW: Important UBB News For Licensed Users","991","http:\/\/www.ultimatebb.com\/home\/versions.shtml","http-cgi-ultimatebb"]}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2000-0142","seq":"2000-0142"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Proposed","desc":"The authentication protocol in Timbuktu Pro 2.0b650 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via connections to port 407 and 1417.","refs":{"ref":"20000211 Timbuktu Pro 2.0b650 DoS"},"votes":{"accept":"Bishop, Blake, Cole, LeBlanc","modify":"Frech, Levy","noop":"Baker, Christey"},"comments":{"comment":["XF:timbuktu-auth-dos","BID 984","BUGTRAQ:20000412 Timbuktu DoS repaired by Netopia\nhttp:\/\/www.securityfocus.com\/archive\/1\/54850\nBID:984"]}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2000-0143","seq":"2000-0143"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Interim","desc":"The SSH protocol server sshd allows local users without shell access to redirect a TCP connection through a service that uses the standard system password database for authentication, such as POP or FTP.","refs":{"ref":["20000211 sshd and pop\/ftponly users incorrect configuration","ssh-redirect-tcp-connection"]},"votes":{"accept":"Blake, Cole, LeBlanc","modify":"Frech","noop":"Baker, Bishop","reject":"Levy","reviewing":"Christey"},"comments":{"comment":["XF:ssh-redirect-tcp-connection","[Cole changed vote from REVIEWING to ACCEPT]","Examine the thread at\nhttp:\/\/marc.theaimsgroup.com\/?l=bugtraq&m=95055978131077&w=2\nto ensure that this problem is being characterized\nappropriately.","SSH is working as designed.
