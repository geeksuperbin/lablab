Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by using the out of bounds access for unintended reads, writes, or frees, potentially leading to code corruption, control-flow hijack, or an information leak attack.","refs":{"ref":["https:\/\/helpx.adobe.com\/security\/products\/acrobat\/apsb17-36.html","102140","1039791"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-16363","seq":"2017-16363"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions.
