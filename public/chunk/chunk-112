This means that the request is presented to the error page with the original HTTP method. If the error page is a static file, expected behaviour is to serve content of the file as if processing a GET request, regardless of the actual HTTP method. The Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M20, 8.5.0 to 8.5.14, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.43 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.77 did not do this. Depending on the original request this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for static error pages including, if the DefaultServlet is configured to permit writes, the replacement or removal of the custom error page. Notes for other user provided error pages: (1) Unless explicitly coded otherwise, JSPs ignore the HTTP method. JSPs used as error pages must must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method. (2) By default, the response generated by a Servlet does depend on the HTTP method. Custom Servlets used as error pages must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method.","refs":{"ref":["[tomcat-users] 20170606 [SECURITY] CVE-2017-5664 Apache Tomcat Security Constraint Bypass","http:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technetwork\/security-advisory\/cpuoct2017-3236626.html","https:\/\/security.netapp.com\/advisory\/ntap-20171019-0002\/","http:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technetwork\/security-advisory\/cpujan2018-3236628.html","http:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technetwork\/security-advisory\/cpuapr2018-3678067.html","https:\/\/support.hpe.com\/hpsc\/doc\/public\/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbux03828en_us","http:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technetwork\/security-advisory\/cpujul2018-4258247.html","DSA-3891","DSA-3892","RHSA-2017:3080","RHSA-2017:2633","RHSA-2017:2635","RHSA-2017:2636","RHSA-2017:2637","RHSA-2017:2638","RHSA-2017:1801","RHSA-2017:1802","RHSA-2017:1809","RHSA-2017:2493","RHSA-2017:2494","98888","1038641"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-5665","seq":"2017-5665"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"The splt_cue_export_to_file function in cue.c in libmp3splt 0.9.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) via a crafted file.","refs":{"ref":["https:\/\/blogs.gentoo.org\/ago\/2017\/01\/29\/mp3splt-null-pointer-dereference-in-splt_cue_export_to_file-cue-c\/","95906"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-5666","seq":"2017-5666"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"The free_options function in options_manager.c in mp3splt 2.6.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free and crash) via a crafted file.","refs":{"ref":["https:\/\/blogs.gentoo.org\/ago\/2017\/01\/29\/mp3splt-invalid-free-in-free_options-options_manager-c\/","95908"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-5667","seq":"2017-5667"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"The sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks function in hw\/sd\/sdhci.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds heap access and crash) or execute arbitrary code on the QEMU host via vectors involving the data transfer length.","refs":{"ref":["[oss-security] 20170130 CVE request Qemu: sd: sdhci OOB access during multi block SDMA transfer","[oss-security] 20170131 Re: CVE request Qemu: sd: sdhci OOB access during multi block SDMA transfer","[oss-security] 20170212 Re: Re: CVE request Qemu: sd: sdhci OOB access during multi block SDMA transfer","[debian-lts-announce] 20180906 [SECURITY] [DLA 1497-1] qemu security update","http:\/\/git.qemu-project.org\/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=42922105beb14c2fc58185ea022b9f72fb5465e9","https:\/\/bugzilla.redhat.com\/show_bug.cgi?id=1417559","GLSA-201702-28","95885"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-5668","seq":"2017-5668"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"bitlbee-libpurple before 3.5.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a file transfer request for a contact that is not in the contact list.

These types of issues occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, the application will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The exploitation of the vulnerability manifests as a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign executable running under the context of the application.","refs":{"ref":["https:\/\/www.symantec.com\/security_response\/securityupdates\/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170821_00","100200"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-6330","seq":"2017-6330"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"Symantec Encryption Desktop before SED 10.4.1MP2 can allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via crafted web requests.\"","refs":{"ref":["https:\/\/www.symantec.com\/security_response\/securityupdates\/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170907_00","100552"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-6331","seq":"2017-6331"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"Prior to SEP 14 RU1 Symantec Endpoint Protection product can encounter an issue of Tamper-Protection Bypass, which is a type of attack that bypasses the real time protection for the application that is run on servers and clients.","refs":{"ref":["43134","https:\/\/www.symantec.com\/security_response\/securityupdates\/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20171106_00","101502","1039775"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-6332","seq":"2017-6332"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem.
