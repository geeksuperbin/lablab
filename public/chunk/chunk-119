The attacker needs to send HTML code directly as a message, and then reply to that message to trigger this vulnerability. The Signal-Desktop software fails to sanitize specific HTML elements that can be used to inject HTML code into remote chat windows when replying to an HTML message. Specifically the IMG and IFRAME elements can be used to include remote or local resources. For example, the use of an IFRAME element enables full code execution, allowing an attacker to download\/upload files, information, etc. The SCRIPT element was also found to be injectable. On the Windows operating system, the CSP fails to prevent remote inclusion of resources via the SMB protocol. In this case, remote execution of JavaScript can be achieved by referencing the script on an SMB share within an IFRAME element, for example: <IFRAME src=\\\\DESKTOP-XXXXX\\Temp\\test.html> and then replying to it. The included JavaScript code is then executed automatically, without any interaction needed from the user. The vulnerability can be triggered in the Signal-Desktop client by sending a specially crafted message and then replying to it with any text or content in the reply (it doesn't matter).","refs":{"ref":"20180516 CVE-2018-11101: Signal-desktop HTML tag injection variant 2"},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2018-11102","seq":"2018-11102"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"An issue was discovered in Libav 12.3.

By adding a URL path parameter with special encodings, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. In this particular attack, different character encodings used in path parameters allows secured Spring MVC static resource URLs to be bypassed.","refs":{"ref":["https:\/\/pivotal.io\/security\/cve-2018-1199","RHSA-2018:2405"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2018-11990","seq":"2018-11990"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem.
