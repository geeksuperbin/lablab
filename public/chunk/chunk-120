A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Specifically, it may prevent use of a physical CPU for an indeterminate period of time.

Only emulated SCSI disks (specified as \"sd\" in the libxl disk configuration, or an equivalent) are affected.

Additionally, CDROM devices (that is, devices specified to be presented to the guest as CDROMs, regardless of the nature of the backing storage on the host) are not affected; they are always read only. Only systems using qemu-xen (rather than qemu-xen-traditional) as the device model version are vulnerable. Only systems using libxl or libxl-based toolstacks are vulnerable.

(In earlier versions, provided that the patch for XSA-142 has been applied, attempts to create read only disks are rejected.)
