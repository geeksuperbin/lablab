Those other components will decode any URI passed to them. To protect against directory traversal the Grails Resource Plugin did the following: normalized the URI, checked the normalized URI did not step outside the appropriate root directory (e.g. the web application root), decoded the URI and checked that this did not introduce additional \/..\/ (and similar) sequences. A bug was introduced where the Grails Resource Plugin before 1.2.13 returned the decoded version of the URI rather than the normalized version of the URI after the directory traversal check. This exposed a double decoding vulnerability. To address this issue, the Grails Resource Plugin now repeatedly decodes the URI up to three times or until decoding no longer changes the URI. If the decode limit of 3 is exceeded the URI is rejected. A side-effect of this is that the Grails Resource Plugin is unable to serve a resource that includes a '%' character in the full path to the resource. Not all environments are vulnerable because of the differences in URL resolving in different servlet containers. Applications deployed to Tomcat 8 and Jetty 9 were found not not be vulnerable, however applications deployed to JBoss EAP 6.3 \/ JBoss AS 7.4 and JBoss AS 7.1 were found to be vulnerable (other JBoss versions weren't tested). In certain cases JBoss returns JBoss specific vfs protocol urls from URL resolution methods (ClassLoader.getResources). The JBoss vfs URL protocol supports resolving any file on the filesystem. This made the directory traversal possible. There may be other containers, in addition to JBoss, on which this vulnerability is exposed.","refs":{"ref":"https:\/\/pivotal.io\/security\/cve-2014-3626"},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2014-3627","seq":"2014-3627"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"The YARN NodeManager daemon in Apache Hadoop 0.23.0 through 0.23.11 and 2.x before 2.5.2, when using Kerberos authentication, allows remote cluster users to change the permissions of certain files to world-readable via a symlink attack in a public tar archive, which is not properly handled during localization, related to distributed cache.","refs":{"ref":["[hadoop-general] 20141121 [ANNOUNCE] Apache Hadoop 2.5.2 released","60079","60432"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2014-3628","seq":"2014-3628"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Admin UI Plugin \/ Stats page in Apache Solr 4.x before 4.10.3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the fieldvaluecache object.","refs":{"ref":["[www-announce] 20141229 Apache Solr 4.10.3 released","62024"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2014-3629","seq":"2014-3629"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in the XML Exchange module in Apache Qpid 0.30 allows remote attackers to cause outgoing HTTP connections via a crafted message.","refs":{"ref":["20141107 CVE-2014-3629: Apache Qpid's qpidd can be induced to make http requests","http:\/\/packetstormsecurity.com\/files\/129034\/Apache-Qpid-0.30-Induced-HTTP-Requests.html","71004","62235","apache-qpid-cve20143629-info-disc(98575)"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2014-3630","seq":"2014-3630"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in the Java XML processing functionality in Play before 2.2.6 and 2.3.x before 2.3.5 might allow remote attackers to read arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, or have unspecified other impact via crafted XML data.","refs":{"ref":["https:\/\/infocon.org\/cons\/SyScan\/SyScan%202015%20Singapore\/SyScan%202015%20Singapore%20presentations\/SyScan15%20David%20Jorm%20-%20Finding%20and%20exploiting%20novel%20flaws%20in%20Java%20software.pdf","https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/#!msg\/play-framework\/7uNX_ImTW08\/AogWSjsTAyQJ","https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/#!topic\/play-framework\/WdbFvemsFDQ","https:\/\/playframework.com\/security\/vulnerability\/CVE-2014-3630-XmlExternalEntity"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2014-3631","seq":"2014-3631"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"The assoc_array_gc function in the associative-array implementation in lib\/assoc_array.c in the Linux kernel before 3.16.3 does not properly implement garbage collection, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via multiple \"keyctl newring\" operations followed by a \"keyctl timeout\" operation.","refs":{"ref":["36268","http:\/\/git.kernel.org\/?p=linux\/kernel\/git\/torvalds\/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=95389b08d93d5c06ec63ab49bd732b0069b7c35e","http:\/\/www.kernel.org\/pub\/linux\/kernel\/v3.x\/ChangeLog-3.16.3","https:\/\/bugzilla.redhat.com\/show_bug.cgi?id=1140325","https:\/\/github.com\/torvalds\/linux\/commit\/95389b08d93d5c06ec63ab49bd732b0069b7c35e","USN-2378-1","USN-2379-1","70095","111298"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2014-3632","seq":"2014-3632"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"The default configuration in a sudoers file in the Red Hat openstack-neutron package before 2014.1.2-4, as used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux Open Stack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, allows remote attackers to gain privileges via a crafted configuration file.
