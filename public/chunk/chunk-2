The reference for 2000-0756 states that there is a\nbuffer overflow in the birthday AND the e-mail field, as well as other\nsuspected fields. As this current candidate only addresses the\nbirthday field, it seems that there are likely different lines of code\ninvolved.\nMicrosoft is not specific about what specifically the patch\naddresses. It is possible that the other overflows in 2000-0756 are\nstill vulnerable and that the @stake group just didn't bother to test\nthem.\nWe will not know the answer until someone retests those other\nfields to see if they are still vulnerable.\nIf they are, then 2000-0756 might deserve being split up.","XF:outlook-vcard-dos(5175)","Consider adding BID:2459"]}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2001-0146","seq":"2001-0146"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Modified","desc":"IIS 5.0 and Microsoft Exchange 2000 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory allocation error) by repeatedly sending a series of specially formatted URL's.","refs":{"ref":["MS01-014","VU#796584","2440","2441","iis-malformed-url-dos(6171)","exchange-malformed-url-dos(6172)"]},"votes":{"accept":"Baker, Cole, Lawler, Ziese","noop":"Christey","recast":"Frech"},"comments":{"comment":["(SF-EXEC)\nXF:iis-malformed-url-dos(6171)\nXF:exchange-malformed-url-dos(6172)\nNot only is this two applications, but it is fixed by two patches.\nQuoting Microsoft:\nBecause the flaw occurs in two different code modules, one of which installs\nas part of IIS 5.0 and both of which install as part of Exchange 2000, it is\nimportant for Exchange 2000 administrators to install both the IIS and\nExchange patches below. \nAlso, in the description, avoid using an apostrophe on \"URLs\" when it is\nsimply plural and not possessive (aka the \"grocer's apostrophe\").","Consider adding BID:2440","Consider adding BID:2441"]}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CVE","name":"CVE-2001-0147","seq":"2001-0147"},"status":"Entry","desc":"Buffer overflow in Windows 2000 event viewer snap-in allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a malformed field that is improperly handled during the detailed view of event records.","refs":{"ref":"MS01-013"}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CVE","name":"CVE-2001-0148","seq":"2001-0148"},"status":"Entry","desc":"The WMP ActiveX Control in Windows Media Player 7 allows remote attackers to execute commands in Internet Explorer via javascript URLs, a variant of the \"Frame Domain Verification\" vulnerability.","refs":{"ref":["20010101 Windows Media Player 7 and IE vulnerability - executing arbitrary programs","MS01-015","media-player-execute-commands(6227)"]}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CVE","name":"CVE-2001-0149","seq":"2001-0149"},"status":"Entry","desc":"Windows Scripting Host in Internet Explorer 5.5 and earlier allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via the GetObject Javascript function and the htmlfile ActiveX object.","refs":{"ref":["20000926 IE 5.5\/Outlook Express security vulnerability - GetObject() expose user's files","20000926 IE 5.5\/Outlook Express security vulnerability - GetObject() expose user's files","MS01-015","1718","ie-getobject-expose-files(5293)"]}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CVE","name":"CVE-2001-0150","seq":"2001-0150"},"status":"Entry","desc":"Internet Explorer 5.5 and earlier executes Telnet sessions using command line arguments that are specified by the web site, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands if the IE client is using the Telnet client provided in Services for Unix (SFU) 2.0, which creates session transcripts.","refs":{"ref":["20010313 Internet Explorer and Services for Unix 2.0 Telnet Client","MS01-015","2463","7816","ie-telnet-execute-commands(6230)"]}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CVE","name":"CVE-2001-0151","seq":"2001-0151"},"status":"Entry","desc":"IIS 5.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a series of malformed WebDAV requests.","refs":{"ref":["MS01-016","iis-webdav-dos(6205)","oval:org.mitre.oval:def:90"]}},{"@attributes":{"type":"CVE","name":"CVE-2001-0152","seq":"2001-0152"},"status":"Entry","desc":"The password protection option for the Compressed Folders feature in Plus!
