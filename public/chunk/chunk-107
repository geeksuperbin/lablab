An attacker can intercept an arbitrary radio frame exchanged between a BiSecur transmitter and a receiver to obtain the encrypted packet and the 32-bit serial number. The interception of the one-time pairing process is specifically not required. Due to use of AES-128 with an initial static random value and static data vector (all of this static information is the same across different customers' installations), the attacker can easily derive the utilized encryption key and decrypt the intercepted packet. The key can be verified by decrypting the intercepted packet and checking for known plaintext. Subsequently, an attacker can create arbitrary radio frames with the correct encryption key to control BiSecur garage and entrance gate operators and possibly other BiSecur systems as well (\"wireless cloning\"). To conduct the attack, a low cost Software Defined Radio (SDR) is sufficient. This affects Hoermann Hand Transmitter HS5-868-BS, HSE1-868-BS, and HSE2-868-BS devices.","refs":{"ref":["https:\/\/docs.wixstatic.com\/ugd\/28ba71_6ecc3158975a484d827e935edda4fa17.pdf","https:\/\/www.trustworks.at\/publications"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-17911","seq":"2017-17911"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"packages\/core\/contact.php in Archon 3.21 rev-1 has XSS in the referer parameter in an index.php?p=core\/contact request, aka Open Bug Bounty ID OBB-278503.","refs":{"ref":"https:\/\/www.openbugbounty.org\/reports\/278503\/"},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-17912","seq":"2017-17912"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"In GraphicsMagick 1.4 snapshot-20171217 Q8, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in ReadNewsProfile in coders\/tiff.c, in which LocaleNCompare reads heap data beyond the allocated region.","refs":{"ref":["[debian-lts-announce] 20180108 [SECURITY] [DLA 1231-1] graphicsmagick security update","[debian-lts-announce] 20180627 [SECURITY] [DLA 1401-1] graphicsmagick security update","http:\/\/hg.graphicsmagick.org\/hg\/GraphicsMagick\/rev\/0d871e813a4f","https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/p\/graphicsmagick\/bugs\/533\/","DSA-4321"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-17913","seq":"2017-17913"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"In GraphicsMagick 1.4 snapshot-20171217 Q8, there is a stack-based buffer over-read in WriteWEBPImage in coders\/webp.c, related to an incompatibility with libwebp versions, 0.5.0 and later, that use a different structure type.","refs":{"ref":["http:\/\/hg.graphicsmagick.org\/hg\/GraphicsMagick\/rev\/6dda3c33f35f","https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/p\/graphicsmagick\/bugs\/536\/","DSA-4321"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-17914","seq":"2017-17914"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"In ImageMagick 7.0.7-16 Q16, a vulnerability was found in the function ReadOnePNGImage in coders\/png.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (ReadOneMNGImage large loop) via a crafted mng image file.","refs":{"ref":["[debian-lts-announce] 20180101 [SECURITY] [DLA 1227-1] imagemagick security update","https:\/\/github.com\/ImageMagick\/ImageMagick\/issues\/908","USN-3681-1"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-17915","seq":"2017-17915"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"In GraphicsMagick 1.4 snapshot-20171217 Q8, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in ReadMNGImage in coders\/png.c, related to accessing one byte before testing whether a limit has been reached.","refs":{"ref":["[debian-lts-announce] 20180108 [SECURITY] [DLA 1231-1] graphicsmagick security update","[debian-lts-announce] 20180627 [SECURITY] [DLA 1401-1] graphicsmagick security update","http:\/\/hg.graphicsmagick.org\/hg\/GraphicsMagick\/rev\/1721f1b7e67a","https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/p\/graphicsmagick\/bugs\/535\/","DSA-4321"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2017-17916","seq":"2017-17916"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"** DISPUTED ** SQL injection vulnerability in the 'find_by' method in Ruby on Rails 5.1.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the 'name' parameter.
