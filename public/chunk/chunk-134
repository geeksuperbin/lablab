An attacker can send a crafted XPC message to the privileged helper tool requesting it make a new OpenVPN connection. Because he or she controls the contents of the XPC message, the attacker can specify the location of the openvpn executable, which could point to something malicious they control located on disk. Without validation of the openvpn executable, this will give the attacker code execution in the context of the privileged helper tool.","refs":{"ref":"https:\/\/github.com\/VerSprite\/research\/blob\/master\/advisories\/VS-2018-015.md"},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2018-9106","seq":"2018-9106"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"CSV Injection (aka Excel Macro Injection or Formula Injection) exists in the export feature in the Acyba AcySMS extension before 3.5.1 for Joomla! via a value that is mishandled in a CSV export.","refs":{"ref":["44370","https:\/\/www.acyba.com\/acysms\/change-log.html"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2018-9107","seq":"2018-9107"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"CSV Injection (aka Excel Macro Injection or Formula Injection) exists in the export feature in the Acyba AcyMailing extension before 5.9.6 for Joomla! via a value that is mishandled in a CSV export.","refs":{"ref":["44369","https:\/\/vel.joomla.org\/articles\/2140-introducing-csv-injection","https:\/\/vel.joomla.org\/resolved\/2136-acymailing-5-9-5-csv-injection","https:\/\/www.acyba.com\/acymailing\/change-log.html"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2018-9108","seq":"2018-9108"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"CSRF in \/admin\/user\/manage\/add in QuickAppsCMS 2.0.0-beta2 allows an unauthorized remote attacker to create an account with admin privileges.","refs":{"ref":"https:\/\/github.com\/quickapps\/cms\/issues\/187"},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2018-9109","seq":"2018-9109"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"Studio 42 elFinder before 2.1.36 has a directory traversal vulnerability in elFinder.class.php with the zipdl() function that can allow a remote attacker to download files accessible by the web server process and delete files owned by the account running the web server process.","refs":{"ref":["https:\/\/github.com\/Studio-42\/elFinder\/commit\/157f471d7e48f190f74e66eb5bc73360b5352fd3","https:\/\/github.com\/Studio-42\/elFinder\/releases\/tag\/2.1.36","https:\/\/github.com\/Studio-42\/elFinder\/wiki\/Advisory-about-vulnerability-of-CVE-2018-9109-and-CVE-2018-9110"]},"votes":["\n"],"comments":["\n"]},{"@attributes":{"type":"CAN","name":"CVE-2018-9110","seq":"2018-9110"},"status":"Candidate","phase":"Assigned","desc":"Studio 42 elFinder before 2.1.37 has a directory traversal vulnerability in elFinder.class.php with the zipdl() function that can allow a remote attacker to download files accessible by the web server process and delete files owned by the account running the web server process.
